# About the Project
This project presents a robust robotic system designed to tackle semi-structured object manipulation tasks with an impressive 70% success rate. Developed using the Robot Operating System (ROS2), the system integrates visually guided control to ensure precision in identifying, locating, and orienting objects for effective pick-and-place actions.

A key feature of this project is the custom visually guided control system, which leverages advanced techniques like instance segmentation and principal component analysis (PCA). These methods empower the system to accurately interpret an object's position and orientation, dynamically adjusting the gripper's approach for optimal interaction.

The project also introduces an innovative soft gripper that adapts its form for varied grasping needs. The gripper combines soft pneumatic actuators with a particle jamming suction cup to enhance grasping capabilities, making it ideal for delicate or irregularly shaped objects. This unique design was published and presented at a leading conference, underscoring its contribution to advancing robotic manipulation technologies.

Through this project, I aimed to push the boundaries of robotic object handling, offering practical solutions for real-world applications. It represents a step forward in combining flexibility, adaptability, and precision in robotic manipulation.
